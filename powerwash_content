          "Why Early Access?",
          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SjHGXdmhyBs/maxresdefault.jpg",
          "Simulator games can fall anywhere on a spectrum from serious to daft. We think we know where the right point on that spectrum PWS should be, but we want to test our assumptions by launching into Early Access to get direct feedback from the buying public. Early Access will therefore be used to grow and work with a community that wants to support our game's development. Weâ€™ll be engaging with players to gather feedback and ideas that will shape the game and prioritise new, community-driven features"

          "How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?",
          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SjHGXdmhyBs/maxresdefault.jpg",
          "The full version will be a well-polished, well-rounded game that appeals to as broad an audience as possible. We plan to have multiple game modes, community implemented features and licensed content. Major updates during Early Access will include at least two multiplayer modes and regular new content drops. We have the potential to provide some unusual challenges with more experimental gameplay mechanics; the popularity of such challenges could inform the direction of the game's tone during production"

          "Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?",
          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SjHGXdmhyBs/maxresdefault.jpg",
          "It is likely the price will increase the more that content is added, but we have no conclusive plans at the moment."
